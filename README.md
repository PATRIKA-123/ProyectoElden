## 🔥 Firebase Configuration

**IMPORTANT**: For the application to work correctly, you need to configure Firebase. Follow the detailed instructions in [FIREBASE_SETUP.md](./FIREBASE_SETUP.md).

### Quick Summary:
1. Create a project in [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Enable Authentication (Email/Password)
3. Create a Firestore database
4. Configure your `.env` with the Firebase values

## 👥 User Roles

### Client
- Create account and profile
- View available fields
- Make reservations
- View reservation history
- Cancel own reservations

### Employee

## 🗄️ Database

## 🔄 Migration from IndexedDB

If you had the previous version with IndexedDB:

1. **Local data will be lost** - Firebase is a cloud database
2. **Configure Firebase** following the instructions
3. **Users will need to register again**
4. **Reservations will start from scratch**

### Migration Benefits:
- ✅ Centralized database
- ✅ Real-time between users
- ✅ Persistent data
- ✅ Scalability
- ✅ Enhanced security

## 🚀 Deployment

### Netlify (Recommended)
1. Connect your repository to Netlify
2. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
3. Add these environment variables in Netlify:
   - `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
   - `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
   - `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
   - `VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
   - `VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
   - `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID`
4. Deploy automatically

### Vercel
1. Connect your repository to Vercel
2. Configure framework as Vite
3. Deploy

### Firebase Hosting
1. Install Firebase CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
2. Sign in: `firebase login`
3. Initialize: `firebase init hosting`
4. Deploy: `firebase deploy`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Firebase Configuration Error**: Verify that your `.env` file (local) or your hosting platform's environment variables are correctly configured. Ensure your Firebase Authentication and Firestore services are enabled in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
- **Port Already in Use**: If you see an `EADDRINUSE` error when running `npm run dev`, it means another instance of the project is already running. Close other terminal windows or press `Ctrl + C` in the running terminal to stop it.
- **Node.js Version**: Ensure you are using **Node.js version 16 or higher**. You can check your version by running `node -v` in your terminal.
- **Authentication Issues**: If login fails, verify that Email/Password authentication is enabled in your Firebase project and that your `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY` is correct.

### Data Not Saving
- Check your browser's Developer Tools Console (F12) for specific error messages.
- Verify that your Firestore security rules allow the necessary read/write operations.
- Ensure the user is successfully authenticated before attempting to save data.

### Firebase Configuration Error
